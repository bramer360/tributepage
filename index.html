      <em>“Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that.” -Martin Luther King.</em>
    </h2>
    <h3> Martin Luther King was arguably one of the greatest and most impactful people in recent history. He fought to liberate an entire people group from oppression and viscous injustice that was suffered solely based on the color of their skin, he demonstrated to a nation proper way to combat injustice and inequality, and he left a legacy that, if not neglected, will influence many generations to come.

        <p id="p1"> Dr. King played a major part in the triumph that was the American civil rights movement. One of the first prominent events of the movement was sparked by the King-led bus boycott of Montgomery. The boycott eventually drew national attention, leading, ultimately, to the Supreme Court ruling that the “separate but equal” clause was no longer valid. </p>

        <p id="p2">Perhaps the climax of King’s nonviolent campaign was the March on Washington in 1963, a peaceful campaign for racial equality that drew an estimated 250,000 people. It was here that Dr. King gave his renowned “I Have a Dream” speech, citing the “magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.” Less than 11 months later Congress passed the Civil Rights Act, declaring the illegality of race-based discrimination.

      In the words of King himself, “No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.”
